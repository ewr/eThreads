# eThreads

This is an archive of the code for eThreads, a piece of forum software that 
I wrote and turned into a blog platform and CMS between 1999 and 2005.  

The last time I used the code in production was at the beginning of 2006. It 
was running via mod_perl at the time, though it had begun life as a CGI 
script.

I'm uploading the code here both as a way to look back at the crazy stuff I 
was up to at the time, and because some of the concepts seem to oddly echo 
the same things that I'm working on now.
