This directory contains the schemas and inital data you need to poulate 
into the eThreads database in order for the software to function
correctly.

tables.schema
	This file will create the tables eThreads uses to store its data.
	It is highly recommended to give eThreads its own database free of 
	other applications.

initial.data
	This file sets up the data for the root glomule directory.  It also
	contains look information for each of the glomule modules' default 
	look.

icons.data
	This file contains the SQL for the pale_blue, blue, and HTML icon
	themes.  As a default, the files are pointed to with ethreads.com as
	the host.  For performance and control reasons you may wish to
	download the icon themes from the ethreads.com site and install the
	images locally.  Once you've done this, simply open the icons.data
	file in an editor and replace all instances of ethreads.com/themes
	with the path to your local images.
